I developed a program in Java called "ComplaintLogger" to facilitate the logging of complaints.
<h2> Overview </h2>
As a college student, I developed a program in Java called "ComplaintLogger" to facilitate the logging of complaints. This program demonstrates my proficiency in key Java skills and showcases my ability to create practical applications.

The program starts by prompting the user to enter product details, date, and a complaint using the JOptionPane class, which provides a user-friendly dialog-based interface. This showcases my skills in handling user input and utilizing external libraries.

To ensure a well-formatted output, I utilized the printf method to display the entered details in aligned columns. This demonstrates my knowledge of formatting output using format specifiers in Java.

To handle multiple complaints, I implemented a do-while loop that continues until the user indicates there are no more complaints. This showcases my understanding of control flow structures and looping mechanisms.

Throughout the program, I employed variables and incrementation techniques to keep track of the complaint count. This demonstrates my ability to manage data and perform basic arithmetic operations in Java.

<h2> Java Skills Demonstrated: </h2>

The Java skills demonstrated in this program are:

- Use of ArrayList: The program creates an ArrayList called cars to store a list of vehicles. It demonstrates how to create an ArrayList, add elements to it, access elements using the index, and modify elements.

- Looping: The program uses a for loop to iterate over the ArrayList and print each car. It initializes a loop variable (i) to iterate from 0 to the size of the ArrayList, and then accesses each element using the get() method.

- ArrayList methods: The program uses various ArrayList methods, such as add(), indexOf(), and set(). These methods allow adding elements to the ArrayList, finding the index of an element, and replacing an element at a specific index, respectively.

- Printing output: The program uses System.out.println() to print the report title and the cars in the ArrayList. It demonstrates the basic usage of printing output to the console.

- Enhanced for loop: The program also uses an enhanced for loop (for-each loop) to iterate over the ArrayList and print each car. This type of loop simplifies iterating over collections, such as ArrayLists, by automatically handling the index and providing direct access to each element.

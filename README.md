<h1>ComplaintLogger</h1>
I developed a program in Java called "ComplaintLogger" to facilitate the logging of complaints.
<h2> Overview </h2>
As a college student, I developed a program in Java called "ComplaintLogger" to facilitate the logging of complaints. This program demonstrates my proficiency in key Java skills and showcases my ability to create practical applications.

The program starts by prompting the user to enter product details, date, and a complaint using the JOptionPane class, which provides a user-friendly dialog-based interface. This showcases my skills in handling user input and utilizing external libraries.

To ensure a well-formatted output, I utilized the printf method to display the entered details in aligned columns. This demonstrates my knowledge of formatting output using format specifiers in Java.

To handle multiple complaints, I implemented a do-while loop that continues until the user indicates there are no more complaints. This showcases my understanding of control flow structures and looping mechanisms.

Throughout the program, I employed variables and incrementation techniques to keep track of the complaint count. This demonstrates my ability to manage data and perform basic arithmetic operations in Java.

<h2> Java Skills Demonstrated: </h2>

The Java skills demonstrated in this program are:

- Input/Output using JOptionPane: The code utilizes the JOptionPane class from the javax.swing package to display dialog boxes and prompt the user for input. It demonstrates the ability to interact with the user and gather information through graphical user interface components.

- String Manipulation: The code uses String variables to store and manipulate user input. It showcases skills related to working with strings, such as concatenation and comparison.

- Looping: The code employs a do-while loop to handle multiple complaints. It allows the user to log multiple complaints until they choose to stop. This demonstrates proficiency in implementing loops and controlling program flow.

- Formatted Output: The code utilizes the printf() method to display the logged complaints in a formatted manner. It demonstrates the ability to format and align text in the console output.

- Variable Manipulation: The code increments the complaintCount variable each time a complaint is logged. This showcases skills related to manipulating variables and keeping track of counts or statistics.
